# Sales_project
This project analyzes and predicts sales amounts. It involves data cleaning (handling missing values, encoding, removing duplicates/outliers), exploratory analysis (visualizations, statistics), and predictive modeling with Linear Regression, Random Forest, and SVR. A Streamlit app was built for user input-based predictions.
